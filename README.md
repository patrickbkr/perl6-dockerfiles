# Tyil's Perl 6 build utilities

This repository contains some utilities I use to build [Perl
6](https://perl6.org/). There's a `Makefile` available to make it
straightforward and easy to use. The main purpose of the tools in this
repository is to build
[Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_%28software%29) images suitable
for running Perl 6 applications with. It can also be used to build a Perl 6
installation with a custom [MoarVM](https://moarvm.org/),
[NQP](https://github.com/perl6/nqp) or [Rakudo](https://rakudo.org/) part (or
any or all of them) to test out certain patches or upcoming releases.
